###HackerRank

Working directory for my submissions to [www.hackerrank.com](www.hackerrank.com)

###Usage
All challenges can be run from within their directory by executing:

    node 'script'

###Uses

- JavaScript
- Node

###TODO

It would be nice to run all the scripts like a test suite.

- Launch script (which pulls data from input.txt) and capture the output sent to stdOut
- Compare this output to an output.txt file in the same directory
